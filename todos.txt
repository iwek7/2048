- weird movement of grid when moving and spawning new blocks (visible only when there are already existing blocks)
- color scheme sux
- merged block should slightly grow and shrink to indicate successful merge
- add readme with screenshot
- block should appear after movement
- code todos
- profile memory
- godot warning
- unit tests
- blocks like this will merge incorrectly 4 2 2, move right, should result in 4 4 but will first merge 2 and 2 and then 4 which will result in 8
